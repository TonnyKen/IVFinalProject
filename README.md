# IVFinalProject
This is a project to visualize the regular pattern of email response behavior of an email user and his/her contacts.

In this project. We use a dataset which contains the email information of a user and his/her contacts. 

# What kinds of problems we want to focus on
There are three primary problems we want solve from the data.

1. What is the relationship between response time and who is the specific contact (One may often respond a close friend or the boss faster, but respond a stranger slower). That might indicate who are the contacts that an email user close to and who are not.  

2. What is the relationship between average receiving time from and replying time to a specific contact? And how the response time looks like when comparing with each other?

3. How does the quantity of email between an email user and his contacts distribute over response time? (For a specific contact A, one could reply 3 emails in 5 minutes, 2 emails between 5 and 10 minutes, 4 emails between 10 and 15 minutes…)
